# netstat -- show network status
#  -n    Show network addresses as numbers (normally netstat interprets addresses and attempts
#           to display them symbolically).  This option may be used with any of the display for-
#           mats.
# -r    Show the routing tables.  Use with -a to show protocol-cloned routes.  When -s is also
#           present, show routing statistics instead.  When -l is also present, netstat assumes
#           more columns are there and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.

netstat -nr | awk '/default/ {print $2; exit}'
